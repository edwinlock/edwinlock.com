Consider a vertex colouring game played on a simple graph with *k* permissible colours. Two players, a *maker* and a *breaker*, take turns to colour an uncoloured vertex such that adjacent vertices receive different colours. The game ends once the graph is fully coloured, in which case the maker wins, or the graph can no longer be fully coloured, in which case the breaker wins. In the game gB, the breaker makes the first move. Our main focus is on the class of gB-perfect graphs: graphs such that for every induced subgraph H, the game gB played on H admits a winning strategy for the maker with only ω(H) colours, where ω(H) denotes the clique number of H. Complementing analogous results for other variations of the game, we characterise gB-perfect graphs in two ways, by forbidden induced subgraphs and by explicit structural descriptions. We also present a clique module decomposition, which may be of independent interest, that allows us to efficiently recognise gB-perfect graphs.
