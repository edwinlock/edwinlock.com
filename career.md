## Education
University of Oxford (2016 – present)
DPhil in Theoretical Physics

I am working towards a DPhil (PhD) under the supervision of Felix Parra (University of Oxford) and Jon Hillesheim (Culham Centre for Fusion Energy). My work is focused on measuring and understanding turbulence in fusion plasmas. I am developing a model for the interaction between microwaves and turbulent density fluctuations to analyse and interpret data from the Doppler Backscattering (DBS) diagnostic. DBS is especially important for future tokamaks as it is one of the few available diagnostics which are robust enough to withstand high neutron fluxes. For a layman-friendly introduction to nuclear fusion, consider listening to our Oxford podcast.

University of Cambridge (2012 – 2015)
B.A. (Hons) in Natural Sciences, Double First Class Honours

Part IA: Physics, Materials Science, Computer Science, Mathematics.
Part IB: Physics A, Physics B, Mathematics.
Part II: Experimental and Theoretical Physics.
National Junior College (2008 – 2009)
Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level

## Work Experience
Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (2016 – 2016)
Specialist I (with Joel Yang)

I worked on novel structures for 2D and 3D colour printing near and at the diffraction limit.

Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR (2015 – 2016)
Research Engineer (with Jason Png)

I worked in the plasmonics and photonics group, understanding and designing metasurfaces and nonlinear photonic waveguides. I also co-supervised three high school student interns.

Republic of Singapore Air Force (2010-2012)
Corporal

I was drafted into the military for two years. For the most part, I served in ground logistics at the Peace Prairie Detachment in Texas, a joint chinook detachment run by the Republic of Singapore Air Force and the Texas Army National Guard.
