## Work Experience

#### Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR (2021 &ndash; present)
*Scientist I*

I am working on microwaves for fusion energy.


#### Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (2016 &ndash; 2016)
*Specialist I (with Joel Yang)*

I worked on novel structures for 2D and 3D colour printing near and at the diffraction limit.


#### Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR (2015 &ndash; 2016)
*Research Engineer (with Jason Png)*

I worked in the plasmonics and photonics group, understanding and designing metasurfaces and nonlinear photonic waveguides. I also co-supervised three high school student interns.


#### Republic of Singapore Air Force (2010-2012)
*Corporal*

I was drafted into the military for two years. For the most part, I served in ground logistics at the Peace Prairie Detachment in Texas, a joint chinook detachment run by the Republic of Singapore Air Force and the Texas Army National Guard.
