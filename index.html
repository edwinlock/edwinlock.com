  <h2>About me</h2>
	{{ site.url }}
  <p class="lead">
    I'm a third year DPhil (PhD) student at the University of Oxford, supervised by
    <a class="text-secondary" href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/paul.goldberg/index1.html">Paul Goldberg</a>.
    My current research focuses on pricing and auctions, specifically determining the viability
    of mechanisms in the dual settings of social welfare and profit maximisation. This
    stimulating and active area of research has an abundance of open problems and deep
    implications for the world outside of academia.

  <p class="lead">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I co-founded
  <a class="text-secondary" href="http://testandcontain.com">Test and Contain</a>,
  a project to design and implement a resource-optimal testing and containment mechanism
  that helps protect the health and livelihoods of those hardest hit in low to middle income
  countries. This work is supported by an ACM GCEC'20 grant.

    Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed a BSc in Mathematics (2012-2016) at Germany's
    state distance learning university FernUniversität Hagen and an MSc in Mathematics and
    Computer Science (2017-2018) at the University of Oxford. I also hold a BA degree in Music
    (2008-2012) from the University of Oxford.
