## About me
I'm a research fellow at Nuffield College and a postdoc (Alex Teytelboym group) at the Department of Economics at Oxford University. My current research focuses on pricing and auctions, specifically determining the viability of mechanisms in the dual settings of social welfare and profit maximisation. This stimulating and active area of research has an abundance of open problems and deep implications for the world outside of academia.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I co-founded [Test and Contain](http://testandcontain.com), a project to design and implement a resource-optimal testing and containment mechanism that helps protect the health and livelihoods of those hardest hit in low to middle income countries. This work is supported by an ACM GCEC'20 grant.
