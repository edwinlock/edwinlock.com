      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>My doctoral research focuses on pricing and auctions, specifically providing complexity
      bounds and designing effective algorithms for determining viability of mechanisms in the
      dual settings of social welfare and profit maximisation. This stimulating and active area of
      research has an abundance of open problems and deep implications for the world outside of
      academia.</p>

      <p>I am also interested in mechanisms that maximise the benefits of scarce resources in low to
      middle income countries (LMICs). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I co-founded the
      project <a class="text-secondary" href="http://testandcontain.com">Test and Contain</a>, which
      considers the problem of utilising limited testing resources in an optimal way so as to
      minimise the impact on the health and livelihoods of those who are hardest hit in
      LMICs. This project is supported by a GCEC'20 grant.</p>
