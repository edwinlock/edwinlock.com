      <p>
        My doctoral research focuses on pricing and auctions, specifically providing complexity
        bounds and designing effective algorithms for determining viability of mechanisms in the
        dual settings of social welfare and revenue maximisation. This stimulating and active area of
        research has an abundance of open problems and deep implications for the world outside of
        academia.

        My work on the Product-Mix Auction (PMA), a multi-unit, multi good auction initially
        proposed by
        <a class="text-secondary" href="http://www.paulklemperer.org">Paul Klemperer</a> for
        the Bank of England to provide liquidity to financial
        institutions during the crisis of 2007-8, focuses on finding
        effective algorithms to solve the auction with respect to social welfare and revenue
        maximisation. An implementation for social welfare is available
        <a class="text-secondary" href="https://github.com/edwinlock/product-mix">here</a>.
        In related work, I also study how bidder demand can be <em>learnt</em> via queries to a
        demand or valuation oracle, allowing bidders to participate in PMAs without having to
        understand the bidding language used.
        
      <p>
        I am also interested in mechanisms that maximise the benefits of scarce resources in low to
        middle income countries (LMICs). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I co-founded the
        project <a class="text-secondary" href="http://testandcontain.com">Test and Contain</a>, which
        considers the problem of utilising limited testing resources in an optimal way so as to
        minimise the impact on the health and livelihoods of those who are hardest hit in
        LMICs. This project is supported by an ACM SIGecom GCEC'20 grant. For more information,
