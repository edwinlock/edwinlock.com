## Research
My doctoral research focuses on pricing and auctions, specifically providing complexity
bounds and designing effective algorithms for determining viability of mechanisms in the
dual settings of social welfare and revenue maximisation. This stimulating and active area of
research has an abundance of open problems and deep implications for the world outside of
academia.

My work on the Product-Mix Auction (PMA), a multi-unit, multi good auction initially
proposed by [Paul Klemperer](http://www.paulklemperer.org) for the Bank of England to provide
liquidity to financial institutions during the crisis of 2007-8, focuses on finding
effective algorithms to solve the auction with respect to social welfare and revenue
maximisation. An implementation for social welfare is available
[here](https://github.com/edwinlock/product-mix). In related work, I also study how bidder demand
can be *learnt* via queries to a demand or valuation oracle, allowing bidders to participate in PMAs
without having to understand the bidding language used.

I am also interested in mechanisms that maximise the benefits of scarce resources in low to
middle income countries (LMICs). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I co-founded the
project [Test and Contain](http://testandcontain.com), which considers the problem of utilising
limited testing resources in an optimal way so as to minimise the impact on the health and
livelihoods of those who are hardest hit in LMICs. This project is supported by an ACM SIGecom
GCEC'20 grant. For more information, watch the 1 minute
